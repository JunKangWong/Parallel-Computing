# Assignment01 - Simulation of Vector Clock (POC)
Proof of concept of Vector Clock in Python 

# Assignment02 - TSUNAMI DETECTION IN A DISTRIBUTED WSN
In this project, we simulate and examine the
problem of effective communication between
tsunameter sensor nodes, a satellite altimeter and a
base station that connects them. Each sensor node
is simulated as a hybrid MPI-pthread process in a
Cartesian grid topology and the base station is
simulated as a separate hybrid MPI-pthread
process along with the satellite altimeter. Then, we
will analyze the performance of our program on
the MonARCH (Monash Advanced Research
Computing Hybrid) Cluster and analyze the
performance of our architecture with the tabulated
results generated.
